## Project Overview

-Title: Escape The Clinic

-Plataform: PC Standalone

-Genre: 3D Escape Room

-Game Engine: Unity 3D (2019.4.17)


## High Concept

Escape the Clinic is a First Person, 3D Escape Room game where the Player see some messages on his phone saying that he is poisoned and must escape from the clinic because if he can't do it in time he'll die. With that the player must solve all (five) puzzles to escape. The puzzles included find especific objects in the map  find the solutions to unlock doors and understand the tips that were left in the clinic. 

## Synopsys

The Player awakes in a clinic and he just can find his mobile phone. In the mobile phone he receive messages explaining that he must escape from that clinic before he dies, because he's actually poisoned. This narrative argument is justified later when the player opens a door and inside of the room he can find toxic barrels indicating that he's trully poisoned another narrative argument is that the player can't known for sure how much time he have, but during the game his vision is affected by a red vignette border, indicating that he's dying slowly.

## Game Objectives

The main objective is to find all the objects and solutions for the puzzles so the player can escape through the Exit Door.

## Game Rules

The game level is a closed environment set in a Medical Clinic where the Player must unlock doors and find the correct position, order or complete the challenges to find the final key that opens the Exit door. The interactions are with the Level Objects, equipments and doors.

## Game Structure

The Structure is linear and the player must find the solution for each puzzle in order so the complete the game. During this meantime the player is dying and if he can't complete the puzzles in time he lost the game.

#Level Design

The level design of this game was made mainly with the package: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/hospital-medical-office-modular-165327
The ideia is that it seems a little dark with low lights but apparently clean and normal.

#Sound Design

I selected a Background Music that leads the game in a thrilling ambient. other sounds like the objects interaction are dry to help the ambience.
